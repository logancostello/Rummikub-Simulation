# Rummikub Starting Simulation
In the game of rummikub, you need to have a play worth 30 points to start the game

## Question
How likely is it that you can enter the game on your first turn?

## Short Answer
35%

## Long Answer
After simulating 1 million starting hands, 34.9% of them would allow a player to enter the game on their first turn.
However, this simulation did not contain jokers. My best guess is that with jokers, the probability is about 36-37%, since pulling a joker is very rare, 
but it does greatly improve your chances of being able to play.
